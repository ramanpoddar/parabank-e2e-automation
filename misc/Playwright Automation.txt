2. VSCode
3. Create folder in local system and open it from vscode
4. Install Playwright using terminal : npm init playwright@latest [npm - node package manager]

Playwright Commands :
Command to check playwright and node js version : npm playwright -v , node -v

Command to generate report in Cucumber : npx cucumber-js features/eCommerce.feature --format html:cucumber-report.html
Command to install Claude tool : npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
Command to run claude: Claude
Command to install Playwright Test Agents : npx playwright init-agents --loop=vscode
Steps to Install MCP Server in VSCode : Install Github Copilot > Open Agent Mode > Click on Setting Icon in Agent Mode > In Configure Tool Window Click on Add MCP Server Icon >
Click on NPM Package Option > Enter @playwright/mcp > Press Enter > click Allow > Select Local Workspace and Click Enter > Wait for mcp.json file to create

Notes:
1. page fixture → Your browser tab — lets you visit websites and interact with them.
   test → Defines a test case — like writing step-by-step tasks to check something works.
   expect (assertion) → Checks if something is correct — like confirming a button is visible or a text appears.
   async await → Allows waiting — so actions like page loading or clicking finish before moving on.
   async → When we interact with a browser using tools like Playwright, most actions — like loading a page, clicking a button, 
   or waiting for an element — don’t happen instantly. They take some time.In JavaScript, asynchronous operations let your code keep running 
   without waiting for each step to finish — instead of freezing the app, it moves on and comes back to the result when it’s ready.
   Real-world example of async:
   Imagine ordering food at a restaurant — instead of standing by the counter waiting, you place the order (async action) and move on. 
   The server (browser) calls you when the food is ready.
2. code generator, buil in locators, hard and soft assertions,
3. css locator way: ul>li label input  or //ul/li/a/label/input,
4. page.$$, textcontent, for of loop, Before and After hooks
5. XPath Locator to locate using text : //button[normalize-space()="Simple Alert"]
5. playwright.config.js : In this config file, configure browser to test and headless mode inside use block - headless : false. 
6. Value check → await inside ; Condition wait → await outside
7. features -> Support folder - Tags, Hooks

git command:
Initialize Git: git init
Check file status: git status
Add file: git add tests/Alert.spec.js
Commit changes: git commit -m "Your message here"
Connect to remote repo: (only once) :git remote add origin <repo-url>
Push to remote repo: git push origin main
Get User email : git config --global user.email
Get User name : git config user.name
Delete file : git rm filename
